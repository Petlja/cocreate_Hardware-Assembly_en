# Collaboration

## How to collaborate effectively

Follow these rules to ensure an **inclusive, respectful, and co-responsible** collaboration process; group assessment reflects how effectively these are demonstrated.

- 1. We are all equal and we respect one another.
- 2. We foster a good atmosphere even when we think differently.
- 3. We are all responsible for group work and results.
- 4. We help everyone contribute to group work.
- 5. We strive to involve everyone in decision-making.
- 6. We consider many ideas before selecting the best one.
- 7. We expound on ideas, weigh arguments, and devise solutions.
- 8. We use time wisely to work on the task.
- 9. We monitor progress and plan the next step.

## Exercise: discuss problematic situations

Discuss the following situations and agree on a solution; reflect on: (1) what went wrong and which rules were violated, (2) which rules the group applied to solve it, (3) lessons to improve future teamwork.

1) One student admits no prior experience and is allowed to sit aside, contributing minimally and feeling excluded by session end.  
2) A missing screw leads to blaming and tension, harming atmosphere and progress.  
3) Disagreement on removal order escalates into argument and lost time, yielding confusing tutorial notes.  
4) Disagreement about tutorial detail level (short notes vs. long explanations) blocks progress.  
5) Assigned photographerâ€™s photos are blurry and incomplete, preventing tutorial completion and upsetting others.
