- Motherboard: CPU socket type (e.g., LGA, AM), **RAM slots** (number and type), Expansion slots (PCI, PCIe, M.2), USB ports (2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, USB-C), Data and power **connectors** (SATA, Molex, M.2, NVMe) **Chipset and overall compatibility**.
- RAM: Capacity and technology (e.g., DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4), Transfer rate and frequency, Timings, ECC support, **Chip layout**
- Hard Drive (HDD): Rotation speed (RPM), Data transfer rate, Data and power connections, **Connectors** (SATA, Molex).
- Solid State Drive (SSD): **Connectors** (SATA, M.2 SATA, NVMe PCIe), Read/write speed (MB/s or GB/s).
- Processor (CPU): Number of cores and threads, Base and turbo frequency (GHz), Cache (L1, L2, L3), Power consumption (TDP), **Compatibility with motherboard/socket**.
- Cooling Systems: Fans (size, RPM, airflow in CFM), CPU cooler (air or liquid cooling), **Thermal paste** (thermal conductivity W/mK)
- Case / Chassis: **Form factor** (ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX), Cable management features, Space for fans, Drive bays for HDD/SSD.

# COURSE DESCRIPTION

In this course, learners will **safely and collaboratively disassemble and reassemble a computer system**, identify and record its components, and produce clear, accurate technical documentation of the entire process across four sessions.

- Session 1 - Collaboration and Safety Rules: Form work groups, review **collaboration tips**, and cover **safety protocols** for handling hardware.
- Session 2 - Developing a Disassembly Tutorial: Disassemble a computer and create a **disassembly tutorial** with notes and photos.
- Session 3 - Creating a Hardware Inventory: Identify and document component specifications to build a **hardware inventory**.
- Session 4 - Developing an Assembly Tutorial: Reassemble the computer and create an **assembly tutorial** with photos and descriptions.

At the end of every session, groups record progress and individual contributions so instructors can monitor task advancement and collaboration.

## MATERIALS

- 1 PC/laptop per group for disassembly and assembly
- 1 PC/laptop with Internet access per group for resources and platform
- 1 mobile phone for taking pictures
- 1 tool kit per group (precision screwdrivers, anti-static wrist strap, zip ties, pliers, thermal paste, anti-static brush)

## ASSESSMENT

Work will be assessed based on **group progress each session**, teamwork organization and collaboration effectiveness, and the final product: **a disassembly and assembly tutorial**.

By the end of this course, each student should be able to:

- Apply correct procedures to assemble and disassemble a computer system.
- Demonstrate safe practices handling hardware components.
- Identify and record basic technical specifications (brand, model, capacity) of key components.
- Produce clear and accurate technical documentation of the process.
- Apply effective collaborative strategies and reflect on the collaborative process.
