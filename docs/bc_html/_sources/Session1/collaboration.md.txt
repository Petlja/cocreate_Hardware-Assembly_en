# Collaboration

## How to collaborate effectively

Follow these rules to ensure an **inclusive, respectful, and co-responsible** collaboration process; group assessment reflects how effectively these are demonstrated.

- 1. We are all equal and we respect one another.
- 2. We foster a good atmosphere even when we think differently.
- 3. We are all responsible for group work and results.
- 4. We help everyone contribute to group work.
- 5. We strive to involve everyone in decision-making.
- 6. We consider many ideas before selecting the best one.
- 7. We expound on ideas, weigh arguments, and devise solutions.
- 8. We use time wisely to work on the task.
- 9. We monitor progress and plan the next step.

## Exercise: discuss problematic situations

Discuss the following situations and agree on a solution; reflect on: (1) what went wrong and which rules were violated, (2) which rules the group applied to solve it, (3) lessons to improve future teamwork.

1) One student admits no prior experience and is allowed to sit aside, contributing minimally and feeling excluded by session end.  
2) A missing screw leads to blaming and tension, harming atmosphere and progress.  
3) Disagreement on removal order escalates into argument and lost time, yielding confusing tutorial notes.  
4) Disagreement about tutorial detail level (short notes vs. long explanations) blocks progress.  
5) Assigned photographer’s photos are blurry and incomplete, preventing tutorial completion and upsetting others.

## SAFETY PROTOCOLS

Before handling hardware, follow safety rules to protect people, equipment, and environment; mistakes can cause injuries, damage, or hazards like fire and electric shock.

We review eight key areas:

1. Workplace Safety  
2. Accident Prevention  
3. General Risk Factors  
4. General Risk Factors in Computer Handling  
5. Safety Signs  
6. Workshop Precautions  
7. Methods and Systems for Fire Extinguishing  
8. First Aid

### 1) Workplace safety

Set of **techniques and procedures** to eliminate or reduce risk of workplace accidents and damage to people, property, and environment, aiming to prevent accidents and minimize consequences.

### 2) Accident prevention

Prevent abnormal, unintended, avoidable events that interrupt work and may cause injuries by knowing risks, accepting it can happen anytime and to anyone, and understanding real consequences and losses.

### 3) General risk factors

- Environmental setting: Ensure thermal, visual, and acoustic comfort to avoid errors, distractions, fatigue, or irritability.
- Organization: Training, information, communication, and group relationships should support comfortable, well-adapted work.
- Psychic comfort: Discomfort may appear short-term (irritability, anxiety), medium-term (sleep disturbances, headaches), or long-term (depression, GI, cardiovascular, skin issues).

### 4) General risk factors in computer handling

- Electrical installations: Power can cause electric shock.
- Materials with fire risk: Short circuits may cause fires in devices and building systems.
- Handling tools or components: Tools and parts present risks.
- Work environment: Noise, humidity, dust, cold, etc., affect health.
- Forced postures: Work posture can cause physical problems.
- Handling loads: Carrying heavy materials can injure.
- Mental load and addiction: Long concentration can be a risk; excessive computer use can lead to addictions requiring attention.

### 5) Safety signs

Know and respect warning signs on equipment and packaging.

Besides precautions, check compliance with major regulations, especially those of the European Community.

- Regulated by the United States and Canada (found on drives, etc.):

- Regulated by the European Union (EU safety standards):

- European Electrical Certification Standards (EU electrical safety standards):

- Regulated by German standards (Geprüfte Sicherheit):

### 6) Workshop precautions

![](./media/image6.png)

- Location: Dry, well-ventilated, well-lit, non-carpeted, grounded surface.
- Static electricity: Greatest danger to parts; use an anti-static wrist strap.
- Power supply: Turn off and unplug before handling; never remove grounding wire. ![](./media/image24.png) ![](./media/image32.png)
- Cuts: Beware sharp tools and case edges; deburr edges if needed.
- Disassembling components: Do not open PSUs or monitors due to high-voltage capacitors even when unplugged. ![](./media/image21.png) ![](./media/image45.png)
- Toxicity: Some components may be toxic, often via wounds. ![](./media/image22.png)
- Short circuit or fire: Avoid conductive liquids and loose metal objects; ensure ventilation isn’t blocked.

### 7) Methods and systems for fire extinguishing

Extinguishing methods: oxygen suppression, fuel suppression, heat removal, projection of chemicals.

Extinguishing systems:

- ![](./media/image27.png) Fire extinguishers
- ![](./media/image51.jpg) Fire hose reels
- ![](./media/image15.png) Dry risers in buildings
- ![](./media/image38.png) Automatic sprinklers

Fire classes (A, B, C, D, K) indicate burning materials (e.g., A: paper, textiles; B: flammable liquids; C: electrical).

![](./media/image48.png)

Suitable extinguishers by class:

| Extinguisher Type | CLASS A | CLASS B | CLASS C | CLASS D | CLASS K |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Foam Spray | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| ABC Powder | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Carbon Dioxide | No | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| Wet Chemical | Yes | No | No | No | Yes |
| Water | Yes | No | No | No | No |

When dealing with electrical equipment (e.g., computers), use a **Class C extinguisher** (e.g., CO₂ or Halotron) to avoid conduction and device damage.

### 8) First aid

- Treatment of wounds: Clean with water and mild soap, disinfect with alcohol, remove foreign objects if present, disinfect again, leave exposed if safe or cover with a bandage.
- Treatment of burns: Remove clothing not stuck to skin, immerse in cold water 10 minutes (repeat every 40 minutes if pain persists), see a doctor if pain does not subside.
- Eye emergencies: Treat only by ophthalmologists; for burns use cleaning/cold water; for trauma cover the eye; for periorbital contusions apply ice indirectly.
- Toxic substances: If corrosives ingested, drink milk or water; if acidic, take magnesium; if alkaline, take vinegar/lemon; bring a sample to hospital and contact toxicology; if non-corrosive, induce vomiting by stimulating the uvula or drinking salty coffee.
